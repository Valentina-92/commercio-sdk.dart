entirely based on [Sacco.dart](https://github.com/commercionetwork/sacco.dart).

The main features are:

* Entirely made in Dart
* Completely stateless

Thanks to these characteristics, you can use this SDK inside any pure Dart project or even any Flutter application.

that you might want to perform on the Commercio.network blockchain.
